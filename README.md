## Bus Mall
This website displays three randomly selected images of products and asks the
user to pick the preferred of the three. When the full 25 choice test is 
complete a button appears which will create a list of the results as well as
display a bar chart of the total clicks per item, and a pie chart that lists the
highest picks per viewed products by percentage they were selected per views.

### Credits
Thankyou Lillian McBride for catching me up on using event listeners and
showing a simple way to display the image elements on the html page.
